Bugmon TC is a series of tools for running bugmon processes as isolated tasks in Taskcluster

## Installation
```shell script
git clone https://github.com/MozillaSecurity/bugmon-tc
cd bugmon-tc
poetry install
```

## Overview
Bugmon-TC includes 3 console entry-points which represent the 3 phases of bugmon analysis (monitor, process, report)

### bugmon-monitor
The monitor phase is responsible for querying bugzilla, identifying bugs that need to be analysed, and storing the bug contents as an artifact.  Monitor is responsible for creating two additional tasks; process and report.

### bugmon-process
The process phase is reponsible for analysing the bug artifact produced by the monitor task.  The results of this process will also be stored as an artifact for later consumption by the report task.  

This task is considered untrusted and does not have access to the Bugzilla API key.

### bugmon-report
The report task is responsible for consuming the artifact generated by the process task and reporting those results to Bugzilla.
